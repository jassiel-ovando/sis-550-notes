# Introduction to Decision Making

## What Should You Know Before Studying Decision Analysis?

> Definition of 'decision' (oxford languages): A conclusion or resolution reached after a consideration.

Shackle (1966) considers a decision the cut between the past and the future.

Decision analysis involves developing alternatives and selecting a course of action to address problems or opportunities.

## Is Decision Analysis study Worth it?

- Decision analysis is a relatively new or contemporary topic (originating in the 1970s).
- Throughout history, people have been making decision constantly, not only on a personal level but also in professional or work-related contexts.
- Think about it on investment, governance, administrative, business-related decision choices and even military strategies.
- It provides an analytical and rational way of viewing decisions.
- It's a process for finding and choosing a course of action to solve a specific problem.
- In the administrative field, decision analysis is a specific set of procedures and techniques aimed at reducing the probability of making mistakes when making business-related decisions.

### What Value does it Hold?

Despite being just one stage within the planning process of administrative work, decision making is of utmost importance. It shapes the direction of a company and determines subsequent actions in the administrative process.

Another reason to consider decision analysis important is the process inherently involves evaluating and suggesting improvements or changes within the administrative scope.

## Elements of Decision Making

1. An objective or situation to solve.
2. Possible options fro choice.
3. Alternatives or characteristics and their weighting or evaluation.
4. Probability associated with each alternative.

> A necessary condition for decision analysis is the existence of at least two alternatives.

## Is Making Decision Easy?

The stages of decision marking, as per Robbing (2005), include:

1. Identifying the problem.
2. Identifying the decision criteria.
3. Assigning weights to criteria.
4. Developing alternatives.
5. Analyzing those alternatives.
6. Selecting one of those alternatives.
7. Implementing that chosen alternative.
8. Evaluating the effectiveness of that implementation.

The difficulties encountered during decision making can vary depending on the situation. Common challenges include:

- Risks associated with decision-making.
- Uncontrollable  contingencies during plan execution.
- Human errors.
- Uncertainty, not only in the decision made but also in its execution.
- Time constraints leading to hasty decision.
- Lack of consensus when multiple parties are involved in decision-making.
- Resistance to change from individuals affected by the decisions.

## Problems

### What is a Problem?

A problem is a situation where the actual state of things differs from the desired state, requiring actions for improvement.

#### What Causes a Problem?

> Change.

Problem starts when there's a difference between what it was expected to happen to what it actually happens.

#### How is a Problem Solved?

Terminating the cause that caused it or the difference between the expected and the actual condition.

### Methods for Problem Resolution

There are various methods for its resolution, some of them are:

- Projects
- 8 Disciplines
- SCAMPER
- DO IT
- Decision Tree
- Cause-Effect
- 5 Whys
- Mind Mapping
- And many more...

### Phases of a Problem

#### Definition, Analysis and Fractionating

- Identify
- Define
- Fractionate

The project goal is a statement tells us what problem we need to solve.

#### Information Research

- Research
- Choose
- Deal

We look for many solutions that leads us to the initial problem.

#### Design

The project design is the task propose elaboration process according to requirements and systematical procedures.

#### Planning

- Decide
- Organize

We need to organize and organize the necessary tasks to build the object. We need to divide all the process in simple and structured operations.

#### Construction

Practical phase of the project: We need to make the product. We can build a physical object or the implementation of a service.

#### Evaluation

1. Product
2. Process
3. Teamwork

It is needed to verify and evaluate all the work done, so we can improve the results and avoid the same errors and future projects.

#### Dissemination

Share the project and its result with the public.

Usually disseminated in documentation.

### Problem vs. Decision Making

Closely related concepts, as decisions are essential for solving problems.

## Analysis Conclusion

1. The significance of marketing.
2. Identifying long-term trends.
3. Focusing on your product.
